**Dark**

The dark lay silent today
In the arms of death
In the warmth of blood
as red as a rose.

The dark lay silent today
Embracing the ultimate
that light bestowed upon it
The martyrs kingdom,
the fallen castle
crushed by emperor
of light.

Will dark accept its fate
or rise again
to avenge its loss?
Or just lay there 
in the silence
for death
again?
