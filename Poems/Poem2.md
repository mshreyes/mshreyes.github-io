**Ugly**

They called me ugly
'Yes, I am', I said.
But I'm still human,
Ain't I?

What's ugly? And what's pretty?
Who sets the standards so high,
Which divide us as species
and unite as judgemental allies?

Ain't ugly a relative term?
So you compare me to else?
Now, I understand
The perks of being an ugly man.

You get to know your appearance
for no cost at all 
and a shower of false pathos
from the order of ravish halls.

Why do I need a mirror then?
What do I have to see?
Oh! You made me believe - I'm ugly.
Now I judge myself too.

Yes, they called me ugly.
But I'm a human too,
ain't I?
