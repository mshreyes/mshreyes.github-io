**Heart is a place full of black holes**

Heart is a place full of black holes\
'Cause it's empty being full\
Lonely and dark,\
Yet radiates back \
When asked,"You alive?"\
"Yes, for a few more seconds", it says.\
And then engulfs every thought and idea\
Every melancholy and delight\
And leaves in eternal darkness\
But it wakes up with a burst\
And gives back more than taken
