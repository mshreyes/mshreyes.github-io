**It all comes to end**

It all comes to end. 
It all falls.
Leaving the dreams and hopes,
Once built upon the foundations of the melody,
We danced upon.
All will be gone,
All will be annihilated.
Like the life we once expected.
'Guess that's what life's like.
Cruel and unforgiving.
Better l learn to live with it in pieces,
than to die in airy of memories.
