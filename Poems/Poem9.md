**Will I be remembered?**

Will I be remembered
when the shore is reached
when the ship is anchored? 

Will I be remembered
when the trees grow high
or when the birds paint
the blue sky?

Or will I be forgotten
like million others
Like the air once breathed 
like the thunder once heard
Like the silence of the ocean?

Will I be remembered
Or will I be lost
like the pages once held
this poem?
