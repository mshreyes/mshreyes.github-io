**Vastness of the Universe**

The sky was dark as coal
with a few stars
glittering like dew drops
illuminated by sunlight

But as the night grew
the sky bloomed into something new
it expanded like a balloon

My problems burst at this site
I wondered how tiny my concerns were
In the light of this darkness
this vastness.

How small
My existence.
I questioned myself
Do I even matter?
