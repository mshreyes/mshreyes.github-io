**Introduction:** 

Hello there! 

I'm Shreyes. I'm an university student and I like to try new stuff. I created this site to keep track of my projects, writings and notes. Feel free to explore. Hopefully you'll find something of interest.

I write at **[We Guys Thought](https://weguysthought.com/)**.
