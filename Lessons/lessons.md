## Lessons & Notes

***

Trying to teach whatever interesting things I've learned so far. In a way, this is my learning progress in the following subjects. I'll try to cover more subjects as time progresses. 

***

- **Languages**: Language learning progress, vocab, resources and tips. (WIP)
    - [Korean](lang/korean.md)
    - Japanese 
    - Esperanto 

- **Science**: Notes, fun facts and tiny lessons. (WIP)
    - [Physics](science/physics.md)
    - [Biophysics](science/biophysics.md)

**Note**: These lessons are based on whatever I've understood about particular topics. There are bound to be errors somewhere but I will try my best to minimize them.
