#### Quotes and Facts

- {*Richard Feynman*} The path integral is essentially the wave function. Hence the path integral formalism is completely equivalent to the Schr√∂dinger and Heisenberg formalisms.

- {*Carl Sagan*} Surrounding our Sun is a spherical swarm of giant snowballs composed of ice and rock and organic molecules: the cometary nuclei. Every now and then a passing star gives a tiny gravitational tug, and one of them obligingly careens into the inner solar system. There the Sun heats it, the ice is vaporized, and a lovely cometary tail develops.

- {*R. Shankar*} The equations are very smart. When you find some laws in mathematical form, you have to follow the mathematical consequences; you have no choice.
