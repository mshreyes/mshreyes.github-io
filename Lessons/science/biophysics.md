#### Quotes and Facts:

- Even though a plant don't have a nervouse system like we humans do, it does use action potentials for communication. But the ions responsible for this action potential are different than in humans. (Ions involved in generation of action potential in humans are K+, Na+, Cl- and Ca2+). Watch [this](https://youtu.be/pvBlSFVmoaw) video for more info.

- Human retina has two photosensitive cells - rod and cone. Rod cells are sensitive to less intense light waves while cone cells are sensitive to more intense light waves. Thus, rods are responsible for vision in dim light and cones are responsible for coloured vision. The distribution of these cells is such that rods have high distribution in the periphery of retina and cones are concentrated at the retina's centre. This is why images seen from telescope look clearer when seen sideways (since light from stars is less intense).
