Projects that I've worked on (including both major and mini projects)

***

1. **Topic**: Feasibility of a Dyson ring

    **Abstract**: Solar power being an important energy source for life on earth, is least exploited. This project will attempt at studying and predicting whether it is possible to substantiate the idea of Dyson ring, which has been around for a long time, in order to utilize solar energy on a larger scale. In order to simulate this
    idea, Wolfram Language (Mathematica) was used.\
    Read **[here](https://github.com/mshreyes/mshreyes.github.io/blob/master/Project/Dyson%20ring.pdf)** and (readable) code **[here](https://github.com/mshreyes/mshreyes.github.io/blob/master/Project/Dyson%20Ring%20(Code).pdf)** \
    Source code: **[link](https://github.com/mshreyes/mshreyes.github.io/blob/master/Project/Dyson_ring.nb)** (Mathematica)

#### Mini-Projects:
1. **Topic**: Analysis of Lorenz Equations

    - Stability analysis of fixed points for Lorenz equations
    - Numerical solutions 

    Read **[here](https://github.com/mshreyes/Computational-Physics/blob/master/LSA/Lorenz_analysis.pdf)**\
    Source files: **[link](https://github.com/mshreyes/Computational-Physics/tree/master/LSA)** (Fortran95 and GNUPlot)


#### Programming

- **[Fortran](https://github.com/mshreyes/Fortran_Programs)**: A collection of Fortran 90/95 programs.

- **[Computational Physics](https://github.com/mshreyes/Computational-Physics)**: Notes and implementation of computational methods (in Fortran 90/95).
