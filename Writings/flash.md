#### 1. Edge

"Marty, don't walk near the edge. Haven't you heard the stories?" a worried Juna questioned.

Marty knew well the risks of playing near the Edge, but he was was a carefree soul. 

"Calm down, Juna. Nothing ever hap-" before he could complete the sentence a feather from Marty's left wing touched the edge. And the very next instant, his wings completely burnt off. 

Juna left the scene screaming, calling for help. But hardly anyone ever visited the edge. Marty was in bad luck today. He lay there with remnants of his wings still on his back, as black as charcoal with only the thin skeletal part still holding onto whatever was left. Crawling away from the edge, slowly, Marty left a trail of tears on his way back to the safe zone.

In a nearby tree's shadow, he was gasping his final breath. No one ever lived long enough with their wings gone. Marty was no exception. He died moments later. Juan reached there late. Broken, she never went back to the Edge.

The edge had consumed another victim. Marty was now a part of the Edge's ever burning world. A world far away and unforgiven compared to the gentle, windy world he had grown up on. With an inextinguishable fire burning in his eyes, he entered through the door, to begin his journey on the otherside of the Edge.
