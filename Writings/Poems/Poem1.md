**Preserve**

Preserve pain\
For it is eternal\
Delight is nothing \
But transitory

Preserve light\
For it is to get dark\
Hollow souls\
Be feeding upon pitiful

Preserve anger\
For the wars are over\
But the battles need \
A burning flame

Preserve courage\
For there are few \
On the night of ill\
Die for others

Preserve imperfection\
For the ones incomplete\
Have a chance to grow\
Perfect is obsolete

Preserve quietness\
For the world is full of \
Gabby beings\
But the stoics are few

Prepare for death\
For it is final\
Left is nothing behind\
Just some melodic thoughts\
And melancholic retentions
