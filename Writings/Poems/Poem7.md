**Silent Corner**

In the silent corner\
I sat with my quiet thoughts\
Thinking of all the times,\
That could have been better.\
And us far more than what we are now.\
But we didn't.

The darkness swept me\
Kept me shackled in it's heart.\
I was hoping you'll save me.\
But you didn't.\
The ciphers of life,\
Why didn't you solve them?\
Why did you ever think,\
that I've lost the hope?\
That I've forgotten that you'll save me one day.\
But you didn't.

The shackles never broke\
And I never tasted freedom as before.\
I was a prisoner now.\
And I would succumb to my wounds, this life left me.\
Memories cuts me and thoughts leave the scar which\
reflect my dreams.\
I might be the reason for this.\
I could've saved this all.\
But I didn't.

And now,\
I can't do a thing.\
Nor can you. \
The separation tears us apart like spacetime.\
Time slips by, one moment at the time.\
The end is soon to arrive,\
As I glance the horizon,\
Thinking I could've and\
what I didn't.
