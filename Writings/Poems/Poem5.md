**When I Fell**

It was only when I fell,\
I realize I could fly.

It was only when I felt pain,\
I knew I was alive.

It was only when I was broken,\
I was able to rise again.

It was only when I failed,\
I was desperate for success.

It was only when I was lost,\
I found myself.

It was then I realize,\
I could fly!
