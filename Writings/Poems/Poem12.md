**Death**

What can be more beautiful\
than death?\
What can be more relaxing\
than the slacking of heart?\
What can be more luscious\
than the sensation of blood\
in your throat?

In your final hours\
what can be more enchanting\
than your last gasp?

The closure of brain.\
What can be more quiet\
than death itself?\
Than silence itself?
