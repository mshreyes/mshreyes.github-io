**This is my story**

I want to sing\
But everytime I open my mouth\
All I hear is a hopeless cry.\
Harmony of destruction.

I want to dance\
But everytime I lift my feet\
I fear I might fall.\
And I do.

I want to learn\
But everytime I want to 'study'\
They ask me my grades.\
They judge me.

I want to write\
But everytime I pen my words\
They just disappear on the canvas \
Of judgemental souls.

I want fly \
But everytime I spread my wings\
People try to snatch my feather.\
I fall, miserably.

Now I want to die\
But everytime I want to kill myself\
A voice from inside cries\
'Is this how you want\
your story to be written?'

'No' I say\
I want to live now\
And no one dares \
to stop me from breathing\
a gasp of joy\
a sigh of failure.

This is my story.
