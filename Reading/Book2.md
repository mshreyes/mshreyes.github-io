### No Country For Old Men
#### *by Cormac McCarthy*

- Fear of an enemy can often blind men to other hazards, not least the shape which they themselves make in the world.

- One of the thing you realize about getting older is that not everybody is going to get older with you.

- Every moment in your life is a turning and every one is a choosing. Somwehere you made a choice. And followed to this. The accounting is scrupulous. The shape is drawn. No line can be reversed.

- A person's path through the world seldom changes, and ever more seldom will it change abruptly. 

- Sometimes people would rather have a bad answer about things than no answer at all.

- There's two kinds of people that don't ask a lot of questions. One is too dumb to and the other don't need to.

- *"If I'm wiser in the ways of the world it come at a price. Pretty good price too."*

- Past a certain age I don't guess there is any such thing as good change.
